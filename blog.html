        <center>Yesterday i was talking with my friend Niko, i was telling him about making a website but it needed to be special, good looking,
                without bloat or javascript and very minimal. Niko suggested using the gif of jesus dancing from the simpsons and as a joke 
                i did a website only with that gif and send it to him. Then i started experimenting with the html and remembered the webring of lainchan
                and their awesome websites/designs so started doing something more serious, then this was the result. Thank you Niko, here is your gif:
